# StockMarketAnalysis
This repo contains visual basic script to compile data and perform analysis on stock market data.

The code loops through a list of data on a worksheet and returns a consolidated list for each worksheet of:
    Ticker Symbol, Change in Price over the course of the year, Percentage Change in Value, and the Total Stock Value

The code highlights in green a positive change in price, and highlights in red a negative change.

As a bonus, the stock with the biggest positive change and the stock with the biggest negative change within the year are also calculated.
the stock with the greatest volume is also calculated.

The final output includes an additional table per year with the stock ticker symbol and value for greatest percent increase, decrease and  total bvolume.

The code loops through each worksheet in the workbook and performs the same analysis on each worksheet.
